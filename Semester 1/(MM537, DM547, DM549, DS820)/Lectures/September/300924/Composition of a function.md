For two functions that share at least one domain/codomain (f.eks. A->B, B->C)
One can make a composition ![[Pasted image 20240930124135.png]]

That makes a function from the first domain, to the last codomain

The reason you put f on the inside is because this composition is going in a specific order (A to C), therefore in this example f(x) must be inside of g(x) because it is what gets calculated first
