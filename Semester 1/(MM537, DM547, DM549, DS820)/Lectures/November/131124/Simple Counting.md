## Definition
Counting techniques are used to count a certain amount of objects that fit specific properties.
We want to determine the [[Cardinality]] of a finite set, where the set is given not explicitly


## Examples
- How many different start hands are there in a card game?
- How many ways are there to split $3k$ people into groups of size 3? (where $k \in \mathbb{N}$)
- What is the number of surjective functions $f: A \rightarrow B$?

## Techniques
- [[Product Rule]]
- [[Sum Rule]]
- [[Subtraction Rule]]
- [[Division Rule]]
- [[Tree Diagrams]]
