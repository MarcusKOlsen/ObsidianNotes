## Definition
A recursive definition involves a **base step** and a **recursive step**
- ### Base step
	- The base step is a simple definition of the starting numbers used in the recursive definition. These must have an actual value, and it's probably smart to use more than one
- ### Recursive step
	- The recursive step defines the approach to use for the following numbers after the base step

This approach to making a definition is reminiscent of [[Set Builder Notation]]. It also sometimes includes it in the definition itself.
The approach to defining the proof is naturally also based on recursion in programming too


## Examples
- ### Fibonacci
	- ![[Pasted image 20241104104116.png]]
	- <center> This is a recursive definition of the fibonacci numbers. </center>
- ### Bitstrings
	- ![[Pasted image 20241104104154.png]]
	- $\lambda$ is the empty string. $\Sigma$ is the alphabet (meaning the different characters that can be used)
- ### Palindromes
	- ![[Pasted image 20241104105426.png]]
	- <center>The recursive definition of all palindromes</center>
- ### Full Binary Trees
