## Definition
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. A matrix of $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called an $m \times n$ matrix. Rows go side to side, columns go up and down

We often denote the entry into the column (in this case $A$) with $i$ and $j$:

> [!example] 
> $A_{i,j}(B_{i,j}, C_{i,j})$
### Applications
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Computer Graphics
- Machine Learning
- Quantum Mechanics

## Examples

> [!example]
> $$
> A = 
> \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
a & b & c
\end{bmatrix} $$
This matrix is a $3 \times 2$ matrix.
