If $(a,b,c) \in A$, with $(a,b),(b,c) \in R$, but $(a,c) \notin R$, then we need to create an $(a,c)$ 'arrow' to close the relation transitively

The relation is closed when $A \bigtimes A$ is correct. ([[Cartesian product of sets]])

(Combining all the steps of the relation, combining them together in one union)
