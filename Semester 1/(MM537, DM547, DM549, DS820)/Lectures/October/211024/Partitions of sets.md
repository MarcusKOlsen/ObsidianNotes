A partition of a set is a size of the set split to have one characteristic that the other half of the relation wont qualify for.

It is described as $N_R$

So in a set of even and uneven numbers and you're determining whether they're even or odd, two suitable partitions would be:

$[0]_R = \{0,2,4,6...\}$
$[1]_R = \{1,3,5,7...\}$
