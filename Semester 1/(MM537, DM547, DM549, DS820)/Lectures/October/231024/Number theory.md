# Divisibility

## Definition
![[Pasted image 20241023132734.png]]

if $a$ is not equal to 0, then $a$ divides $b$ if a $c$ exists such that $ac = b$
## Terminology
- a *divides* b -> $a \mid b$
- a does *not* divide b -> $a \nmid b$

- a is a *factor* of b
- b is a *multiple* of a

# Quotient and remainder

## Terminology

- d is the *divisor*
- a is the *dividend*
- q is the *quotient*
- r is the *remainder*

# Congruence
![[Pasted image 20241023134413.png]]

This is supposed to mean that for example in a modulo 13, the numbers 1 and 13 are essentially the same (congruent), because in this context they both leave the same remainder, which in this case is 0

> [!Example] Definition
> Let $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$, and $m \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$
Then $a \equiv b$ (mod m) 
$\leftrightarrow m \mid a-b$
## Continuence
One can change the numbers on one side, as long as you change it on both sides


> [!Example] Definition
> $a + b \equiv c + d (mod m)$
> $\leftrightarrow a \times b \equiv c \times d$
