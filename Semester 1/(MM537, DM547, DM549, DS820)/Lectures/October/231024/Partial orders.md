A relation on a set $R$ is called a partial order, if it is
- Reflexive
- ***anti***symmetric ([[Relations]])
- transitive

A partial order is very similar to [[Equivalence relations]], with the only difference being that partial orders are antisymmetric instead.

Instead of using R, one often uses $\preceq$ or $\leq$ for partial orders. It is also sometimes called a *poset*
You can only use $\leq$ because if it was $<$, then it wouldn't be reflexive, meaning it needs to be able to call on itself, and call on something else, but something else will not necessarily call on it.
