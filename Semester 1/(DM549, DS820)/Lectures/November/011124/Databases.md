## Terminology
- DBMS : Database Management Systems
	- A set of functions and instructions to manage a database. This is where user access it
## Definition
A large software tool that:
- Stores large amount of data
- Allows for defining a specific structure of that data
	- A database can ensure the data is inputted in a consistent way, which is not possible for a simple file storage system.
- Allows efficient searches and finding of that data
	- Complex operations are much easier to create and uphold in a database compared to a file system
- Guarantees data integrity by using applying [[Integrity Constraints]] to all input
- Allows simultaneous multi-user access
- [[Internal Structure of a Database]]

- Corporate data
- University records

## Types of DBMS
Using different types of DBMS can be important. Data can be modelled and indexed differently compared to which system you use. Some DBMS are also uniquely optimized for specific operations and data.

### Relational DBMS
This is the classic, and most widely used type.
The relation DBMS is designed around:
- Mathematical [[Relations]]
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle

### Graph DBMS
Data is a network in this DBMS, with entities and connections between them. [[Graph Connectivity]]
- Example: neo4j
