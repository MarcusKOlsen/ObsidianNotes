## Examples
([[Graph Connectivity]])
- Graph Connectivity is an example of a **Decision Problem**
	- In graph connectivity the language can be directly solved, but not optimized
- Shortest Paths is an example of an **Optimization Problem**
	- With the use of binary search on $k$. you can optimize the language
- Sorting is an example of a **Construction Problem**
	- With sorting you can construct a solution for any given input
