## Universal Turing Machine
The UTM is the progenitor to the function that exists in programming today


> [!Definition] Definition
> Imagine a turing machine: $T_u$ that can take an input string $s$, and an input machine instruction $T_n$, and create a turing machine that fits the given language

This is in essence just defining functions. In modern day, $T_n$ would just be a function.
