## Definition
The master theorem is a solution to *most* recursion equations. If it does not fit however, one might have to do the [[Recursive algorithms#Recursion Trees|recursive tree method]] manually.

As stated above, the master theorem cannot always be used. The master theorem should be considered as a tool, with pre-calculated solutions for most (not all, however) recursion equations.

In terms of the **exam**, the following is all you need:
- Using the master theorem in situations where it can be applied
- Recognize situations, where the master theorem cannot be applied
## Formula
