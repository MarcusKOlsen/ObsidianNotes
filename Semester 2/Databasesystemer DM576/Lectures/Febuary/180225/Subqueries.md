## Definition
- A query that is part of another query, working essentially as a nested function.
### Ways of using subqueries
- **FROM** clauses, followed by a tuple
- Can return **a single constant**, which can be compared to another value in a **WHERE** clause
	- Returns a single value from a relation, which can effectivize the query
- Can return **relations** which can be compared to another value in a **WHERE** clause
	- Can return entire relations, with specfic info needed.
