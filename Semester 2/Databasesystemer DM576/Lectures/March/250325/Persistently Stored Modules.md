## Definition
PSM, or *persistently stored modules*, allows storing procedures as database schema elements

PSM is a mixture of conventional statements (if, while, etc.) and SQL statements

This lets us do things we cannot do in SQL alone.

A way of creating these in PostgreSQL is with [[Procedures]]
